As the previous upload "Shared Memory", this program will do the same thing. 

Except that:
>>The program receiver.c will now be the client program that will interact with the user. Call it client.c. 
>>The processor.c will be the backend program â€“ call it server.c. 

The client and server programs have the same functionality as described in Assignment 3 except that they should use sockets as a communication mechanism that will allow the client and the server to be run on different machines. 

When the user presses Ctrl-C on the server.c terminal, the server program should display a summary, which should show the number of lines received so far and the total digit count across all input seen by the server.
